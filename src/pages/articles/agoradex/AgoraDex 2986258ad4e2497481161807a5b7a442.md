**Pool page**

*When selecting an existing pool ,users can see the details of it, add liquidity or remove it.*

## Voting

The most complex tool, since we are building this product from scratch and can’t rely on existing functionalities, the features included were creating a written proposal (description, answers, voting token mechanism, time limits), voting on a proposal, and several logic requirements.
